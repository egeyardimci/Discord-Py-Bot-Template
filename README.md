# Discord Py Bot Template
Discord.py is a library that allows you to make discord bots with python. This repo is a template for the bot.

# About The Bot
Bot has  over 10 functions by default you can expand them as you want.

# Setup
First of all you need to have the latest version of python (3.8) once you have that there is two ways to setup: <br />
1) You can do it by manualy, I listed all libraries that is needed in requirements.txt you can do "pip install -r requirements.txt".  <br />
2) You can use the setup.bat file it does the same thing automaticly. <br /> <br />
Once you had that step now you should insert your bot token(you can have it from Discord Developer Site) to settings.py file after that the setup is done. <br /> <br />
Now you can run the Bot.py file (Open a command prompt in the bot file and than run "python Bot.py") to start the bot. <br />
